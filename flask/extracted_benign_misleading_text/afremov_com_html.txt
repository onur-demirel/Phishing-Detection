What makes Leonid Afremov paintings so special?
After years of creative experiments, Afremov has developed his own painting manner that makes his pictures immediately recognizable and uniquely appealing. How is it different from what we usually call art?
- To add volume to his works, the artist uses a very peculiar Impasto technique. By laying oil paint in thick overlapping strokes, he creates a layered texture that gives his paintings a distinct three-dimensional sense.
- Instead of brushes, Afremovwields a rather unusual instrument called palette knife to achieve spectacular visual effects. Pressing the blade down at different angles allows him to apply strokes of different size and shape, from large chunky splashes to the finest lines drawn with the very tip of the knife.
- Afremov paintings strike the eye with a rich color palette. They resemble motley patchworks where all shades of the spectrum are combined into one cheerful mixture, so vivid the eye can barely hold it. That’s why people find his canvas pictures so fascinating and positive.
- In Afremov’s manner, color obviously prevails over shape. Here you won’t find photographic details or precisely reproduced outlines. His artis the world of imagination where how you paint is much more important than what you paint. Each artwork in this gallery is a reflection of Afremov’s soul that captures meaningful moments of life in all their inexplicable charm and striking profundity.
